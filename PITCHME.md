# Why React

- React is a view layer that uses virtual DOM for performance.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- React can be used as the V in MVC.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- React’s true strengths - composition, unidirectional data flow.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

# What we will cover today ?
- Components
- State 
- Lifecycle


#HSLIDE
# components

- Components are basically just functions that return the view based on the current state.

- Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation

- Single responsibility principle, that is, a component should ideally only do one thing.

## More About Components

- Stateful vs Stateless

- Classes and Functions

- Pure and Impure

- Presentational and Container Components

- Composition Patterns

#HSLIDE

## Here are two types of “model” data in React:

- props 
- state

#HSLIDE

## state

- Only components defined as classes can have state.

#HSLIDE
# props

- Props are inputs to a React component. They are data passed down from a parent component to a child component. 

- Remember that props are readonly. They should not be modified in any way.

- Difference between state and props is that props are passed from a parent component, but state is managed by the component itself.

#HSLIDE
## Lifecycle Methods

- Lifecycle methods are custom functionality that gets executed during the different phases of a component
